# GDP Nowcasting for Egypt – Central Bank Use Case

This project was developed as part of a data science use case for a role at the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). The goal was to explore alternative data sources to nowcast GDP in Egypt using Google Trends and other indicators.

## 📁 Files Included
- `notebook.ipynb`: Full code implementation
- `presentation.pdf`: Project summary and visuals presented to the CBE
- `report.pdf`: (Optional) Short written analysis

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
- Google Trends via `pytrends`
- Data preprocessing & modeling
- Ridge Regression, VIF analysis, Random Forest feature importance

## 📌 Highlights
- Built a robust GDP nowcasting model with an R² of 0.88
- Used multiple Google Trends categories to simulate real-time indicators
- Addressed multicollinearity using VIF and Ridge Regularization
